# LGBTQ Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

The primary goal of The Mario Party Toolkit is to be inclusive of the widest range of contributors with diverse backgrounds. We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for behavior within our community and the consequences for unacceptable actions. We encourage everyone to help us create positive and safe experiences for all participants.

## 2. Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship

Our Code of Conduct aims to enhance open [source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging participants to understand and strengthen the relationship between their actions and their effects on the community.

Communities reflect the societies they inhabit, and positive action is necessary to address various forms of inequality and abuses of power. We recognize and appreciate efforts to foster a welcoming, friendly community that encourages full participation.

## 3. Expected Behavior

We expect all community members to:

- Participate actively and authentically, contributing to the health and longevity of our community.
- Exercise respect and consideration in speech and actions.
- Attempt to resolve conflicts through collaboration before escalating them.
- Avoid demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and language.
- Be mindful of your surroundings and fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem minor.
- Remember that online interactions and contributions should be respectful and constructive.

## 4. Unacceptable Behavior
